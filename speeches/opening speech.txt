Welcome to the Christmas light show. You are welcome to take pictures and videos. For your safety, please 
stay off of the lawn as there are multiple cords and plugs in the yard. Please be courteous to other 
drivers by not blocking the roadway and to our neighbors by keeping your radio volume at a reasonable level. 
You may visit throughout the Christmas season. The light show will run nightly starting at 5 30 PM from 
now until January 2nd. Visit the almost engineer dot com slash christmas for more information about the show.
Hope you enjoy the show and have a Merry Christmas
