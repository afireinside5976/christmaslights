As you may know, water and electricity make for a bad combination. 

This combination has resulted in tonight's Christmas light show being cancelled
because of the weather. Hopefully the weather will clear up by tomorrow and the lights can be on display.

Now, back to the Christmas tunes to keep you in the holiday spirit.
